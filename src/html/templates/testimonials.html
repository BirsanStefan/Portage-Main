We recently built a new house in Northeastern Ontario and for many years prior to the built we’ve spent numerous hours researching for an indoor wood boiler that would fit all of our expectations and needs to heat our house. EGR delivered! We have the privilege of using the wood boiler for the last 4 months and we find the unit very sturdy, serviceable, practical, efficient and economical. We are very pleased with the service and warranty your company has offered to date. During this winter season, we’ve used approximately one cord per one and a half weeks to heat the house and garage totaling roughly 4000 sq ft. Therefore, as a consumer, the EGR 100 indoor wood boiler unit is definitely meeting all of our needs to date and we truly recommend this model.",
