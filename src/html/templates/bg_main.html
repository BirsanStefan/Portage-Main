                                            <p>The P&M BL2840 we purchased from Strawbale Farms is a great unit.  This is our third year of running it and the performance has been 100% accurate.  We previously owned a Woodmaster 4400 and the P&M is a far better boiler IMO. It burns hotter, cleaner, alot less wood and very easy to maintain. I wish we would have purchased a P&M to start with.
                                                    It is a very high quality built unit. We are 100% satisfied with our P&M and the great customer service. We would definitely highly recommend a P&M.</p>
